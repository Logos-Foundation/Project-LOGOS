# The Dual-Track Strategy: LOGOS & VELO
## 双轨战略：理念与现实

> "Velo is your SpaceX Falcon 1. Project LOGOS is your NASA."
> "Velo 是你的猎鹰 1 号。Project LOGOS 是你的整个航天事业。"

## 1. The Separation of Concerns (分离关注点)

Project LOGOS adopts a strict separation between **The Standard (Idealism)** and **The Product (Realism)**.

| Dimension | **Project LOGOS** (The Standard) | **Velo Runtime** (The Product) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | NASA / Academy / Standard Committee | SpaceX / Factory / Flagship Product |
| **Mission** | define the "Physics" of future computing. | Deliver "Performance" on today's hardware. |
| **Analogy** | HTML5 Spec / POSIX Standard | Google Chrome / Linux Kernel |
| **Philosophy**| Pure Idealism (The Semantic Truth) | Pragmatic Engineering (The Fast Reality) |
| **Timeline** | The Future (Type-II Civilization) | The Present (Production Ready) |

## 2. Velo: The Trojan Horse (特洛伊木马)

Velo is the **First Adopter** and **Reference Implementation** of the LOGOS architecture.

*   **Internal Adoption**: Velo uses the **V.O.I.D. Memory Layout** (Ring Buffer, Atoms) internally to manage Python objects.
*   **Software Simulation**: Velo does not wait for SCP hardware. It simulates SCP logic in software on x86/ARM/RISC-V.
*   **Performance Proof**: By showing that even a *software simulation* of Logos is 10-50x faster than traditional interpreters (CPython), Velo proves the architectural superiority of Logos to the world.

**Slogan for Velo:**
> *"A high-performance Python runtime, powered by the experimental Logos architecture."*

## 3. Logos: The Open Standard (开放标准)

Project LOGOS operates as a non-profit, open-standard initiative to build the infrastructure for a Type-II Civilization.

*   **The Manifesto**: Defining the "Why".
*   **The Spec**: Defining the "How" (ISA, Atom Format).
*   **The Global Rosetta Map**: Building the "Data". A CC0-licensed semantic dictionary co-constructed by humanity.

**Slogan for Logos:**
> *"The Compute Engine for a Type-II Civilization."*
