# To Avoid Being Compute-Locked on Earth
## 为了不被算力锁死在地球上

**An Open Letter to the Architects, Hackers, and Thinkers of the World.**
**致全球的架构师、黑客与思想者的一封公开信。**

### The Crisis (危机)

70 years ago, **John von Neumann** left us the spark of computing. But today, that spark is burning down our forest.

We are trapping ourselves in a "Computational Inflation." To make a machine understand a simple "Hello," we squander 99% of our electrons in fiber optic cables beneath the oceans and in data centers across deserts, merely for "Translation," "Transport," and "Prediction."

**Our computing power is built upon massive entropy generation.**

If future AI requires a nuclear power plant to run, then AI will forever remain a toy for the giants. If future computing cannot return to "Meaning" itself, we will remain trapped forever in the energy snare of a Type 0.7 Civilization.

**This path leads not to the stars.**

### The Proposal (提议)

Today, we initiate **Project LOGOS**.

We are not here to patch the old world; we are here to redefine what "Computing" is. 
Through the **SCP (Semantic Compute Processor)** architecture, we allow silicon to read human language for the first time. 

We eliminate the middlemen. 
We abolish the decoding tax. 
We end the bloated logic of unnecessary complexity.

*   **No More Decoding**: Let 8-bit atoms directly carry the wisdom of the universe.
*   **Code is Silicon**: Let software logic map directly to hardware order.
*   **Unified Physics**: Let CPU and GPU be reunited at the semantic level.

This is a redemption from **Atom** to **Civilization**. 
This is a ticket to a **Type-II Civilization**.

### The Call (号召)

We do not need you to be an employee of a big corporation; we only need you to be equally tired of meaningless complexity. 

We need you to join us in completing this **"Rosetta Stone"** of the digital age.

*   **To the Philosophers:** Help us define the ontology of the digital universe.
*   **To the Hackers:** Help us build the Global Rosetta Map.
*   **To the Engineers:** Help us teach silicon to speak Logos.

**Join Project LOGOS.**
